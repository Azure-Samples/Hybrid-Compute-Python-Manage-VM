# Hybrid-Compute-Python-Manage-VM

These samples demonstrate how to perform common management tasks
with Microsoft AzureStack Virtual Machines
using the Azure SDK for Python.
The code provided shows how to do the following:

- Create virtual machines:
    - Create a Linux virtual machine
    - Create a Windows virtual machine
- Update a virtual machine:
	- Expand a drive
	- Tag a virtual machine
	- Attach data disks
- Operate a virtual machine:
    - Start a virtual machine
    - Stop a virtual machine
    - Restart a virtual machine
- List virtual machines
- Delete a virtual machine

To see the code to perform these operations,
check out the `run_example()` function in [example.py](example.py).
Each operation is clearly labeled with a comment and a print function.
The examples are not necessarily in the order shown in the above list.


## Running this sample
1.  If you don't already have it, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    This sample (and the SDK) is compatible with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

2.  General recommendation for Python development is to use a Virtual Environment. 
    For more information, see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
    
    Install and initialize the virtual environment with the "venv" module on Python 3 (you must install [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) for Python 2.7):

    ```
    python -m venv mytestenv # Might be "python3" or "py -3.6" depending on your Python installation
    cd mytestenv
    source bin/activate      # Linux shell (Bash, ZSH, etc.) only
    ./scripts/activate       # PowerShell only
    ./scripts/activate.bat   # Windows CMD only
    ```


3.  Clone the repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Hybrid-Compute-Python-Manage-VM.git
    ```

4.  Install the dependencies using pip.

    ```
    cd Hybrid-Compute-Python-Manage-VM
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  Create a [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-create-service-principals) to work against AzureStack. Make sure your service principal has [contributor/owner role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-create-service-principals#assign-role-to-service-principal) on your subscription.

6.  Fill in and export these environment variables into your current shell. 

    ```
    export AZURE_RESOURCE_LOCATION={your resource location}
    export AZURE_TENANT_ID={your tenant id}
    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID={your client id}
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET={your client secret}
    export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID={your subscription id}
    export ARM_ENDPOINT={your AzureStack Resource Manager Endpoint}
    ```

7.  Note that in order to run this sample, Ubuntu 16.04-LTS and WindowsServer 2012-R2-Datacenter images must be present in AzureStack market place. These can be either [downloaded from Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item) or [added to Platform Image Repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-add-vm-image).


8. Run the sample.

    ```
    python example.py
    ```

## Notes

### Retrieving a VM's OS disk

You may be tempted to try to retrieve a VM's OS disk by using
`virtual_machine.storage_profile.os_disk`.
In some cases, this may do what you want,
but be aware that it gives you an `OSDisk` object.
In order to update the OS Disk's size, as `example.py` does,
you need not an `OSDisk` object but a `Disk` object.
`example.py` gets the `Disk` object with the following:

```python
os_disk_name = virtual_machine.storage_profile.os_disk.name
os_disk = compute_client.disks.get(GROUP_NAME, os_disk_name)
```
